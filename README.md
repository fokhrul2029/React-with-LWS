## What is Components

- Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI)

## what is Props

- React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
