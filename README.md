## Event Handling

- In React, event handling refers to the process of capturing and responding to user interactions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or other actions that trigger events. React provides a consistent and declarative way to manage events by using a set of synthetic event wrappers that wrap the native browser events.
