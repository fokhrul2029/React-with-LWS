## React

- "Stateful Components:": Components in React can be either stateful or stateless. Stateful components are ones that have an associated state. Stateful components are created by extending the React.Component class and have the ability to manage their internal state
- i Created a class component as Clock with state and lifecycle hook.

## Lifecycle Hook

- In React, lifecycle hooks (or lifecycle methods) are methods that are called at various stages of a component's existence. They allow you to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component, such as when it is about to be rendered, has been rendered, or is about to be removed from the DOM. These methods help you manage the state, handle side effects, and perform cleanup operations.
